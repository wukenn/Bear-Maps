Bear-Maps
=========
This is a web mapping application of berkeley.

I developed the backend of a mapping application of Berkeley using Java, Apache Maven, and images downloaded from OpenStreetMap. It can handle features such as moving the screen by dragging, zooming in/out, and double clicking two points to find the shortest path.
